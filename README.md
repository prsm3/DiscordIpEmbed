# DiscordIpEmbed
A simple python script that sends your public IP Adress in the form of an embed to a discord server.
## Setup
Setting up is pretty straight forward as I have commented the whole script.
The first step on setting up is to get the Discord Webhook URL from your Discord Server.
To do this you simply have to create a Webhook in your server settings.

Now you can click on copy URL and paste the URL in the designated spot in the python script.

Now save and whenever you run the script it will automatically send your public IP address to the selected channel of the webhook.
